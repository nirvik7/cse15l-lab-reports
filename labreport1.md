__Lab 1 Report__

Here is the step-by-step process I took to log into my course-specific account on ieng6. Although these steps might not work perfectly for you, it should help to guide you through your own process.


*Installing VS Code:*

This part was easy for me as I didn't have to do anything! I already had VS Code so I moved on to the next step. If you do not have VS Code, here is the link to their website: https://code.visualstudio.com/.

*Remotely Connecting*

Unfortunately, my account did not work for some reason so I had to log in with a TA account. In this step, you first open up a terminal and type "ssh" with your account email. Then, once prompted, you type "yes" to establish authentication. You should now be connected and your screen should look like this:

*Trying Some Commands*

There are many commands that you can use in the terminal. Here are some simple ones to try.

-  cd: change directory, cd (name) will change to (name) directory while cd .. will take you back to the previous directory 
-  ls: list files in directory
-  cat: displays file contents
-  cp: copy files
