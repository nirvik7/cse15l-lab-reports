__Lab 4 Report__

*Step 4: Log into ieng6*

Keys pressed: 

```
<Ctrl>+V <Enter>
```

I had the ssh command with the cse email on my computer already so I simply copied it while in Google Chrome and then pasted it into the terminal.

*Step 5: Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account*

Keys pressed: 

```
git clone <Ctrl>+V <Enter>
```

Again, I had the forked repository url sitting in my brower so I copied it. In the terminal, I wrote "git clone", which is obviously the repo cloning command, and pasted in the forked repo url.

*Step 6: Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail*

Keys pressed: 

```
cd lab7 <Enter> <Ctrl>+V <Enter> <Ctrl>+V ListExamples 
```

First, I went into the newly cloned lab7 repo. Because I had the week 7 lab pulled up on my computer with the JUnit commands in the example at the bottom, there was not much left to do. I copied the javac command and pasted it into the terminal and then did the same with the java command, adding in "ListExamples". Light work.

*Step 7: Edit the code file to fix the failing test*

Keys pressed: 

```
cd lab7 <Enter> <Ctrl>+V <Enter> <Ctrl>+V ListExamples 
```

*Step 8: Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed*
