__Lab 2 Report__

*Part 3:*

In week 2, we learned about deploying servers both locally and remotely which was really interesting to me since websites/frontend is kind of where I see myself going towards. First, you compile the two Java files, the server file and the program file, using the javac command. Then, you run the program file, using the java command, with a port number. This deploys the web server locally on the localhost domain using the specific port that you chose. Furthermore, you can run the server remotely, and use the browser from a different computer, by cloning your url repo onto your ieng6 account and deploying the server. The domain will be ieng6-20x.ucsd.edu, with the x representing one of 1, 2, or 3, depending on which you are connected to, and the port number will be again what you chose.
